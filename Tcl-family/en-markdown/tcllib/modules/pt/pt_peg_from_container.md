# Description

Are you lost ? Do you have trouble understanding this document ? In that case please read the overview provided by the *Introduction to Parser Tools*. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current package is a part of.

This package does not exist. There is no need for it. The CONTAINER format for parsing expression grammars is a piece of Tcl code which, then sourced, provides a class whose instances have the grammar we wish to import loaded. Another way of looking at this is, the CONTAINER output is its own import package.

# Bugs, ideas, feedback

If you find errors in this document or bugs or problems with the package it describes, or if you want to suggest improvements for the documentation or the package, please use the [Tcllib Trackers](http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist) and specify *pt* as the category.

When proposing code changes, please provide *unified diffs*, i.e the output of **diff -u**.

Note further that *attachments* are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments can be made by going to the **Edit** form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button in the secondary navigation bar.
